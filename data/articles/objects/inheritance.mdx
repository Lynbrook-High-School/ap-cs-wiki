summary: How one class can inherit the properties and methods of another.
---

In Java, we can inherit fields and methods from one class to another. The parent class
(i.e. the one that is being inherited from) is called the **superclass**, while the child class
that is inheriting from the superclass is called the **subclass**.

Let's consider the following example.

```java
class Animal {
    private String name;
    private String sound;
    private int age;
    
    public Animal(String name, String sound, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sound = sound;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void hello() {
        System.out.println(sound);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getSound() {
        return sound;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal("Bessie", "Moo", 5);
        animal.hello(); // prints "Moo"
    }
}
```

Say we wanted to write a new class called `Dog`. This class should 
also have fields for their name, sound, and age. However, now we want to
add a new attribute for how loud the dog barks. Because all of the attributes
we want in our `Dog` class can be found in our `Animal` class, we can use inheritance
to reuse the code we already wrote.

```java
class Animal {
    private String name;
    private String sound;
    private int age;
    
    public Animal(String name, String sound, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sound = sound;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void hello() {
        System.out.println(sound);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getSound() {
        return sound;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    private int noiseLevel;

    public Dog(String name, String sound, int age, int noiseLevel) {
        super(name, sound, age);
        this.noiseLevel = noiseLevel;
    }

    public void bark() {
        if (noiseLevel >= 100) {
            System.out.println("WOOF!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("woof!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal("Bessie", "Moo", 5);
        animal.hello(); 

        Dog dog = new Dog("Fido", "woof", 6, 100);
        dog.bark(); // prints "WOOF!"
        dog.hello(); // prints "woof"
    }
}
```

There are a few important things to take note from this example.
- When we want to inherit another class, we use the keyword `extends`
  - Format is `class Subclass extends Superclass`
- Subclasses can use the methods of the parent class
  - A notable exception is if the method is declared as being `private`
  - In general, **a subclass cannot access private fields or methods from its 
superclass**
- We need to call the superclass constructor in our subclass constructor
  - If we don't, Java by default will call the no argument constructor
  
To elaborate on the third point, we must call our superclass constructor in some
form **at the top of the constructor**. If we don't, Java will call `super()` for us.
In the code above, it is necessary to explicitly call the superclass constructor because
we want to inherit all the fields from the superclass.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If we don't write a no argument constructor, Java automatically creates one for us.
> However, **this is only if we haven't written any constructors for our class.**

    <QuizMCAnswer number={0} correct>
      The no-args constructor is called for Super, but no such constructor exists.
    </QuizMCAnswer>
    <QuizMCAnswer number={1}>
      The constructor for Sub attempts to access a field in Super.
    </QuizMCAnswer>
    <QuizMCAnswer number={2}>
      x was declared as a public variable, whereas it should have been declared as private.
