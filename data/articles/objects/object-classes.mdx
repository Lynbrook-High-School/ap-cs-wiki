summary: Implementing classes and using objects.

Java is an object-oriented language. That is, in Java, everything is associated with classes and objects.

But first, what is an object? An object is a collection of data and the behavior associated with them. All **classes** are objects.

We refer to the data that an object has as its **fields/attributes**, and its
behaviors as its **methods**.

Note that **all objects are references**. What does this mean? Consider
the following code snippet.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3};
        int[] b = a;
        a[0] = 5;
        System.out.println(a[0]); // 5
        System.out.println(b[0]); // 5
    }
}
```

All `int[]` variables are references to an array object. Thus, when we assign
`b` to `a`, we make `b` a reference to same array that `a` refers to.

Note that this type of behavior doesn't happen in certain cases.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = new String("abc");
        String b = a;
        a = a.toUpperCase();
        System.out.println(a); // prints "ABC"
        System.out.println(b); // prints "abc"
    }
}
```

This behavior occurs because **Strings are immutable**. When we do the assignment
`a = a.toUpperCase()`, we are making `a` refer to a new String object.

Now, on to classes. To create a class, we first declare it.

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In Java, we typically declare all **attributes** as being `private`.
> The philosophy behind this will be explained later.

To initialize our fields `name` and `age`, we write a **constructor**.

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

The declaration of a constructor method is in the following format:

`public ClassName(parameters)`

Note how we assign variables with the following format:

```
this.var = var;
```

The reason we do it like this is to avoid **variable shadowing**. If we didn't
add the `this` qualifier, Java would assign the given variable to itself.
The `this` keyword tells Java that we are referring to our current object.

Another solution is to give our constructor parameters different values from the
values in the class. Some people write it like this:

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Dog(String _name, int _age) {
        name = _name;
        age = _age;
    }
}
```

However, it's generally better practice to do it in the first style.

> [!WARNING]
> We **do not** declare our method to be `void`. Why? Because if we declared it void, then
> Java wouldn't be able to distinguish our constructor from a regular method.

We can also write multiple constructors for our class.

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public Dog(int age) {
        this("fido", age);
    }
}
```

In this example, we call our first constructor with the second one. Note how
we use `this(...)` and not `Dog(...)`. As mentioned earlier, 
the `this`keyword tells Java that we are referring to our current object.
Because we are calling a constructor, we use`this`instead of`Dog`when calling
our constructor. (Also because Java would interpret`Dog` as a normal method)

If we don't write **any** constructor, Java will create a **default no-arguments constructor**.

Writing methods in Java is considerably less nuanced. For the sake of demonstration,
here's a snippet of code demonstrating how methods work.

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public Dog(int age) {
        this("fido", age);
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("woof");
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge > age) {
            age = newAge;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Doge", 12);
        System.out.println(dog.getName() + " " + dog.getAge()); // "Doge 12"
        dog.bark(); // prints "woof"
    }
}
```

Note the inclusion of the `getName`, `getAge`, and `setAge` methods. These are
known as **getter** and **setter** methods.

The philosophy behind having `private` fields and these methods is that we don't
want other classes changing our current class's attributes. In the example above,
we have some code to make sure the given input is valid. We don't want other
classes modifying our `Dog` class's fields directly, which is why we make it
private.
