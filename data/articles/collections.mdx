summary: Exploring the Java collections framework.

The Java collections framework is a set of components that help us represent
a collection of data. To import the framework, we can use the following code:

```java
import java.util.*;
```

Alternatively, our IDE can resolve all of our imports for us.

As seen in the diagram, many of the classes inside the chart are implementations of certain interfaces. For example, `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` are both implementations of the `List` interface, `TreeSet` and `HashSet` are both implementations of `Set`, etc. Understanding how each class/interface is related to each other is important, both for the AP CS class and when programming in general.

Here are some key facts regarding all collections.

- Collections hold references to objects
  - May contain references to two **equal** objects or two of the **same** objects.
- Because they are objects, collection variables are a reference to an object
- The **same** object can be present in multiple objects

Reference [this article](/ap-cs-wiki/articles/object-classes) for information
regarding objects and how they work in Java.

Let's consider the following examples to make these concepts a bit more concrete.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(new Integer(1));
list.add(new Integer(1));
System.out.println(list.get(0).equals(list.get(1))); // true
System.out.println(list.get(0) == list.get(1)); // false
```

In the code snippet above, we added two different objects into our `ArrayList`.
Because we are adding references of objects into our list, comparing the two
objects with `==` returns false.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
Integer x = new Integer(1);
list.add(x);
list.add(x);
System.out.println(list.get(0).equals(list.get(1))); // true
System.out.println(list.get(0) == list.get(1)); // true
```

Here, we added two references of the same object into our list. Thus, 
comparing the two objects with `==` returns true.

> [!TIP]
> In general, always use the `.equals()` method when comparing two objects.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Integer> b = a;

a.add(1);

System.out.println(a.size()); // 1
System.out.println(b.size()); // 1
```

Because our object variables are references to an object, `b = a` essentially
means that `b` currently points to the same `ArrayList` as `a`.

Understanding how objects work is imperative when writing code using collections.
It's [easy to get messed up](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pull/4850)
by forgetting that all collection classes only contain objects. 

Before we cover the most important classes in the collection framework, let's first
explore the key interfaces behind the framework: `Collection`, `Iterator`, and
`Iterable`.

## Collections

The `Collection` interface has a lot of methods that are 
[listed here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html).
Here are the most commmonly used ones:
- `boolean add(E obj)`
- `boolean remove(E obj)`
- `boolean contains(E obj)`
- `int size()`
- `boolean isEmpty()`
- `Iterator<E> iterator()`

Note that `E` is a stand-in for the type we want. These methods provide a set of 
operations that every collection should support.

## Iterators

Iterators allow us to traverse through 
a collection. The `Iterator` interface
has the following methods:
- `default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action)`
- `boolean hasNext()`
- `E next()`
- `default void remove()`

The focal points main idea is that an iterator can move forward in a collection, allowing us to iterate through our collection.

## Iteratable

In Java, the `Collection` interface implements the `Iterable` interface.
This interface has the following methods:
- `default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action)`
- `Iterator<T> iterator()`
- `default Spliterator<T> spliterator()`

These names might seem a bit daunting. In essence, all the `Iterable` interface
does is ensure we can retrieve iterators and iterate using for-each loops in 
our collections.

For reference, a for-each loop looks like this:

```java
ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<>();
for (String i : arr) {
    // do something
}
```

## Iterating Through Collections

We typically use either iterators or for-each loops to iterate through a collection.

```java
Collection<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
```

Using an iterator:
```java
Iterator<String> it = words.iterator();

while (it.hasNext()) {
    String cur = it.next();
    // process cur
}
```

Using a for-each loop:
```java
for (String cur : words) {
    // process cur
}
```
