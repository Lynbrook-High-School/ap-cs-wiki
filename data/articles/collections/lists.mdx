The `List` interface is used to represent a sequentially ordered group 
of items, numbered by indexes (0 based indexing).

Typically, when dealing with the `List` interface, we are dealing with 
`ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. `Vector` is technically supported, but typically is not used.

## ArrayLists

To import `ArrayList`, add the following line at the top of your program.

```java 
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

An `ArrayList` functions as a dynamically sized array. For the full list of methods, see the 
[documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html). 

Here are the most commonly used methods:
- `E get(int index)`
  - Returns the element at the given index (0 based indexing)
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `boolean add(E element)`
  - Appends the element to the end of the list
  - Always returns true
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average
- `void add(int index, E element)`
  - Inserts the element so the given index is its position in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `E remove(int index)`
  - Removes the element at the specified position
  - Returns the removed element
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `boolean remove(Object o)`
  - Removes the first occurence of our object
  - Returns if an object was removed
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `E set(int index, E element)`
  - Sets the value at index to our new element
  - Returns the previous element
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `void clear()`
  - Clears the array
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `Object clone()`
  - Returns a shallow copy of the array
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

> [!NOTE]
> For the `clone()` method, we are creating a new 
> array with the **same references** as the array we are cloning.

An `ArrayList` has two properties: its **size**, and **capacity**.
What does this mean? The size is the number of elements currently
inside the list, and the capacity is the size of the underlying array
that holds contains our list items. As a programmer, we typically don't 
need to worry about the capacity of our list.

As a note, the way the `add` and `remove` operations work is that we 
place our item in the array, then shift all the items accordingly.

## LinkedLists

To import `LinkedList`, add the following line at the top of your program.

```java 
import java.util.LinkedList;
```

A LinkedList is a doubly linked list implementation in Java. For the full list of methods, see the 
[documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html). 

Here are the most commonly used methods:
- `E get(int index)`
  - Returns the element at the given index (0-based indexing)
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `boolean add(E element)`
  - Appends the element to the end of the list
  - Always returns true
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `void add(int index, E element)`
  - Inserts the element so the given index is its position in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `E remove(int index)`
  - Removes the element at the specified position
  - Returns the removed element
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `boolean remove(Object o)`
  - Removes the first occurrence of the specified object
  - Returns true if an object was removed
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `E set(int index, E element)`
  - Replaces the element at the given index with the new element
  - Returns the previous element
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `void clear()`
  - Clears the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `Object clone()`
  - Returns a shallow copy of the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- `E getFirst()`
  - Returns the first element in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `E getLast()`
  - Returns the last element in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `E removeFirst()`
  - Removes and returns the first element in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- `E removeLast()`
  - Removes and returns the last element in the list
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

The general paradigm behind the linked list is that accessing 
items randomly is slower, but removing or adding elements elements 
is faster. 

> [!CAUTION]

> this is $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ because `.get()` has to travel from the front 
> or back *all the way* to our current position, which blows up the number of
