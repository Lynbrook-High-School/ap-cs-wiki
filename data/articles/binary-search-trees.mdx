summary: How binary search trees work.

A binary search tree allows us to efficiently maintain a sorted list of numbers. Java's implementation of it is `java.util.TreeSet`.

## Definition and Properties

As indicated in the name, a binary search tree is a form of binary tree.

Let's consider our binary search tree to have a value written on each one of its nodes. Then, for a tree to be a binary 
search tree, the following properties must hold:

- All nodes in the left subtree must be less than our current node
- All nodes in the right subtree must be greater than our current node

Note that this definition does not allow for repeat elements in our BST.

The reason this definition is special is because it allows us to find, insert and remove elements in $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$ time. 

It's helpful to view the binary search tree as a
decision tree. At every node, we decide if we want
to move to a greater or smaller element in the tree.

## Insertion

To insert a new number, we use the following recursive procedure. 
- If our current node is `null`, insert our new number here
- If our new value is less than our current node's value, move down the left subtree
- If our new value is greater than our current node's value, move down the right subtree

```
FUNCTION InsertNode(curNode, value):
    IF curNode IS NULL:
        CREATE a new node with value
        RETURN the new node

    IF value < curNode.value:
        curNode.left ← InsertNode(curNode.left, value)
    ELSE IF value > curNode.value:
        curNode.right ← InsertNode(curNode.right, value)

    RETURN curNode
```

## Searching

We use a similar recursive procedure to search for elements. Note that the algorithm below is designed
to return a reference to the node with the element we 
are trying to find.

- If our current node is `null`, return `null` 
- If our value is less than our current node's value, recurse down the left subtree
- If our value is greater than our current node's value, recurse down the right subtree
- If our value is equal to the our current node's value, return our current node

```
FUNCTION SearchNode(curNode, value):
    IF curNode IS NULL:
        RETURN NULL

    IF value = curNode.value:
        RETURN curNode

    IF value < curNode.value:
        RETURN SearchNode(curNode.left, value)
    ELSE:
        RETURN SearchNode(curNode.right, value)
```

### Case 1: Deleted Node Has No Children  
Simply delete the given node, as it has no children and its removal doesn't affect the tree's structure.

### Case 2: Deleted Node Has 1 Child  
Replace the given node's value with its child's value, then remove the child node entirely.

### Case 3: Deleted Node Has 2 Children  
1. Identify the **inorder successor**, which is the smallest value in the right subtree.
   - Start at the given node and move to the right child.  
   - Traverse left until reaching a node whose left child is `null`.  

2. Swap the value of the inorder successor with the given node.  

3. Delete the inorder successor node, which will now either have no children or one child. 
   This reduces down to case 1 or case 2.

Why does this work? Let's consider the following facts:
- The inorder successor's value is the smallest value in our tree that is still 
  bigger than the value on our current node
- The inorder successor is still bigger than any node in our given node's left
  subtree, but is smaller than any other node in the right subtree

Based on these facts, we can see that the BST property is still satisfied. 
We also don't need to worry about any nodes outside of our given node's subtree,
as deleting the given node does not affect the minimum or maximum value inside 
the subtree.

```
FUNCTION DeleteNode(curNode, value):
    IF curNode IS NULL:
        RETURN curNode

    IF value < curNode.value:
        curNode.left ← DeleteNode(curNode.left, value)
    ELSE IF value > curNode.value:
        curNode.right ← DeleteNode(curNode.right, value)
    ELSE:
        IF curNode.left IS NULL AND curNode.right IS NULL:
            RETURN NULL
        ELSE IF curNode.left IS NULL:
            RETURN curNode.right
        ELSE IF curNode.right IS NULL:
            RETURN curNode.left
        ELSE:
            minNode ← FindMin(curNode.right)
            curNode.value ← minNode.value
            curNode.right ← DeleteNode(curNode.right, minNode.value)

    RETURN curNode

FUNCTION FindMin(curNode):
    WHILE curNode.left IS NOT NULL:
        curNode ← curNode.left
    RETURN curNode
```

## Miscellaneous Information

Here's a table for the speed of each operation.

| Operation              | Best Case Time Complexity | Worst Case Time Complexity |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Search                | $ \mathcal{O}(\log n) $   | $ \mathcal{O}(n) $         |
| Insertion             | $ \mathcal{O}(\log n) $   | $ \mathcal{O}(n) $         |
| Deletion              | $ \mathcal{O}(\log n) $   | $ \mathcal{O}(n) $         |
| Find Minimum          | $ \mathcal{O}(\log n) $   | $ \mathcal{O}(n) $         |
| Find Maximum          | $ \mathcal{O}(\log n) $   | $ \mathcal{O}(n) $         |

Wait. Where did $\mathcal{O}(n)$ come in? Well, the best case scenario is if 
the tree is completely **balanced**. That is, its form is of that of a perfect 
binary tree or something similar, which has a depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$.
However, our BST can actually degenerate into a line if we insert our elements
in a certain order. Try to figure out when that's the case!

<Spoiler title="Answer">

If we insert our elements in ascending order, the tree will flatten into a 
line of nodes.

</Spoiler>

There are many ways to solve the problem of balancing. These variations are all 
called **balanced binary search trees**. Some examples include but are not limited to:
the AVL tree, the red-black tree, treaps (a.k.a. Cartesian trees), etc. Note that the AP CS curriculum 
does not require knowledge of any of these.

When implementing a BST in Java, we don't need to explicitly delete any nodes.
Removing all references to a node will automatically delete it (because Java
has a garbage collector).
