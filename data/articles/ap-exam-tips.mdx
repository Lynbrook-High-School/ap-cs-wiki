## Studying

You can see the topic distribution [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a).
Of course, this doesn't make any guarantees on what type of problems will show up on the exam, but it 
is good to know to understand which topics occur more frequently, and which ones are rarer.

### MCQs

CollegeBoard unfortunately does not publish previous years' MCQ questions. One option is to go to your AP Classroom and review the previous MCQs you've done.

Ideally, when practicing MCQ you should practice under some form of time limit, to ensure that
you are spending a realistic amount of time on each question.

### FRQs

Luckily, CollegeBoard does publish previous years' FRQs. You can find them all 
[here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions).

Again, if you practice FRQs, setting some timer is a good idea.

## General Exam Tips

The standard advice for any test applies to the AP CS exam: 
- Get proper sleep
- Eat a good (and healthy) breakfast/meal
- Make sure all your paperwork/supplies are in order

Reviewing the content the night before is a good idea, but don't burn yourself out. Try to
get your prep done at least a few days before the exam, instead of cramming it the night before or 
day of the exam.

As a note, **the AP CS exam is now digital**. This removes a lot of the headache that came with 
having to handwrite code.

### MCQs

The MCQ is worth **50%** of your exam score. You are given **40 questions** and **1.5 hours**
to complete these questions.

If we do some math, we find that we have more than 2 minutes per question. In terms of timing,
that gives a lot of time for us to finish our MCQs.

#### Computational Problems

Often, you are given some piece of code, and asked to evaluate what the code prints out/does.
The best way to solve these types of problems is to use your scratch paper, and manually simulate
it; don't try to do it in your head, as this is more error-prone and doesn't allow you
to check your work.

A common strategy in competitions is to take your scratch paper, and divide each side into
four (or more) boxes. This is probably a good idea, as it allows you to organize your work
more effectively.

#### Conceptuals

Often, AP CS A conceptual MCQs will focus on one specific topic. For example, they might
test:
- Knowledge of basic data types
- Operator precedence
- Booleans/conditionals (and De Morgan's Law)
- Iteration
- Objects (basic concepts + inheritance + polymorphism)
- Math + random numbers
- Arrays
- Recursion

Categorizing problems under some topic may help you brainstorm the key concepts needed
to solve said problem.

As with any MCQ problem, you should try to look for any tricks/off-by-ones/similar, and also use process
of elimination. 

### FRQs

The FRQ is worth **50%** of your exam score. You are given **4 questions** and **1.5 hours** to complete
these questions.

It's a good idea to take a look at the official [scoring guidelines](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap24-sg-computer-science-a.pdf).

> Apply the question scoring criteria first, which always takes precedence. Penalty points can only be 
deducted in a part of the question that has earned credit via the question rubric. No part of a question (a, b, 
c) may have a negative point total. A given penalty can be assessed only once for a question, even if it 
occurs multiple times or in multiple parts of that question. A maximum of 3 penalty points may be assessed 
per question. 

To summarize:
- Points are not given additively; rather, you get penalty for mistakes
- There is no double jeopardy when it comes to penalties. A penalty can only be given once per question
- At most 3 penalty points can be assigned per question; the point total for any part of the question must be non-negative

Generally speaking, the graders do NOT care about minor syntax mistakes. That is, if you 
forget parenthesis, braces, etc., they don't mark you off for that. 

> [!WARNING]
> This isn't to say that you should deliberately take shortcuts and write syntactically incorrect
> code. You should still try to write accurate Java code. This is just to say that if you make
> some minor syntax mistake, they probably will choose leniency. The scoring guidelines do note that 
> the correct code should be reasonably inferrable. For example if you have two variables `g` and `G`, and 
> and use the wrong variable, they cannot reasonably infer which variable you intended to use.

However, the following errors will result in a deduction:
1. Array/collection access confusion ([] get) 
2. Extraneous code that causes side-effect (e.g., printing to output, incorrect precondition check) 
3. Local variables used but none declared 
4. Destruction of persistent data (e.g., changing value referenced by parameter) 
5. Void method or constructor that returns a value 

You should be careful to not make errors 1, 4, and 5. Point 4 is a bit hard to decipher;
here's an example of an error.

> Write a method doubledArray that returns a **new array where every value is doubled**.

Wrong code:
```java
public static int[] doubledArray(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i] *= 2;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

Correct code:
```java
public static int[] doubledArray(int[] arr) {
    int[] res = new int[arr.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        res[i] = arr[i] * 2;
    }
    return res;
}
```

The first code snippet is wrong because we are asked to make a **new array** where the values
are doubled. We are **not** asked to double all the values in our input array, as the 
array in our input is a reference to what CollegeBoard calls **persistent data**.

#### Writing Your Response

To improve readability and reduce the likelihood of error, the following practices
are advisable:
- Properly spacing out your code (e.g. spacing out operators, loops, etc.)
- Adding comments when necessary/reasonable
- Use meaningful variable names

These practices will help you reduce the chance of making a mistake, as well as making 
your response easier to read.

Before writing your code, you should at least have a general understanding of how you are 
going to implement your code. Now that the exam is digital, this is *slightly* less important,
as you can now easily revise your code. But it's still a good idea to have some sort of outline
in your head on how to implement your solution.

As another note, in general you shouldn't try to make your code too "cute" or "slick". Just
pick the most straightforward approach! Remember, your goal is to write a correct response,
not the shortest response.
