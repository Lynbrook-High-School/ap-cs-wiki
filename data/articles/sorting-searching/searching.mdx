summary: Going over sequential and binary search.

A common task in programming is to search some data structure (e.g. a list)
for some item. To do this, there are two options: sequential search and binary
search.

## Sequential Search

Let's say we have a list of names, and want to find the first occurrence of a given
name.

Sequential search would have us search from the start of the list and end when
we find the name we want.

```java
/**
 * @param arr our array of names
 * @param name the name we want to find
 * @return the index of the name given, or -1 if not found
 */
public static int findItem(String[] arr, String name) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i].equals(name)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```


| **Case**         | **Time Complexity** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Best Case         | $\mathcal{O}(1)$   |
| Average Case      | $\mathcal{O}(n)$   |
| Worst Case        | $\mathcal{O}(n)$   |


## Binary Search

Consider the following hypothetical game: 

Your friend picks a random number between 
$1$ and $100$. Your goal is to find their chosen
number by asking the minimum number of questions.
For each question, you can query a given number,
and your friend has to tell you if your number is:
- Less than your friend's number
- Equal to your friend's number
- Greater than your friend's number

How would we go about solving this? If using sequential search, we would just
go through every number until we found the number we need.

Binary search takes a very different approach. Initially, the range of possible
values is $[1, 100]$. If we query the value $50$, then we either end up eliminating
the range $[1, 50]$ or $[51, 100]$, halving our search space. We repeat this process
until we have found our answer.

Because we are halving our search space after every query, the total number of 
queries is $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$.

We can now apply this same logic to the problem of searching for an item in an
array. If the array is sorted, we can keep on checking the midpoint of our 
search range until we have our answer.

```
/**
 * @param arr our sorted array of names
 * @param name the name we want to find
 * @return the index of the name given, or -1 if not found
 */
public static int findItem(String[] arr, String name) {
    // the item in question should be in the range [low, high)
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length;
    while (high - low > 1) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid].equals(name)) {
            return mid;
        }
        
        if (arr[mid].compareTo(name) < 0) {
            low = mid;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    
    if (arr[low].equals(name)) {
        return low;
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

<Spoiler title="Formal Definition">

The binary search algorithm finds the **splitting point** in a monotonic
boolean function. What does this mean?

Let's define some function $f(n)$, which returns some boolean for a given input.
| $n$      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| $f(n)$ | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   |

Essentially, $f(n)$ maintains a value (either true or false) for a while, and then
permanently switches after a certain point. Our algorithm finds this switching
point.

As an example, the problem of finding a value in a sorted array can be modeled
as finding the splitting point for the following function:

$$
f(n) = \text{arr}[n] \leq \text{name}
$$

| **Case**          | **Time Complexity**      |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Best Case         | $\mathcal{O}(1)$         |
| Average Case      | $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$   |
| Worst Case        | $\mathcal{O}(\log{n})$   |

## Choosing Which Method To Use

Binary search has the following preconditions:
- The data must be sorted.
- The data structure must allow $\mathcal{O}(1)$ random access (e.g. an array)
  - For example, binary search wouldn't work well on a linked list

Also, for small data, binary search loses its advantage. In fact, because sequential
search is so simple, it's sometimes faster than binary search in smaller data sets.

Thus, for practical reasons, we typically only use binary search on data sets where
sequential search becomes excessively slow.
