summary: How we compare objects in Java.
---

In programming, we often need to search for objects, as well as sort a group
of objects. 

First, before talking about how to search for objects and how to sort objects,
we need to know how to effectively **compare** objects. There are a few ways to 
compare objects.
- The `.equals()` method
- The `.compareTo()` method
- The `.compare()` method

## `.equals()`

As noted in the [objects](/articles/object-classes) article, using the `==`
operator doesn't work as intended for objects because it only checks if the 
references are equal (if they're the **same** object, not **equal**
objects).



We are all probably familiar with the `.equals()` method, as we often have to use
it when comparing strings. Note that if we want to create our own object and have
`.indexOf()` and `.contains()` work with it, we'll need to override the 
`Object equals()` method.

As an example of how to write an `equals` method, consider the following code snippet.

```java
public class Pet {
    private String name;
    
    Pet(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other == null || !(other instanceof Pet)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Pet otherPet = (Pet) other;
        
        return name.equals(otherPet.name);
    }
}
```

The rough idea is as follows:
1. Check if our other object CAN be reasonably compared to our current object.
2. If this is the case, perform the comparison of the items.

## `.compareTo()`

The usage of this method is `obj1.compareTo(obj2)`. This method allows us to
compare objects and determine if one object is "greater" than another.

| **Result** | **Description**                                                                                 | **Example**                                          |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `0`        | Indicates that the two objects being compared are **equal**.                                    | `"abc".compareTo("abc")` returns `0`.             |
| `< 0`      | Indicates that the current object is **less than** the object being compared to.                | `"abc".compareTo("def")` returns `-3`.            |
| `> 0`      | Indicates that the current object is **greater than** the object being compared to.             | `"def".compareTo("abc")` returns `3`.             |

Note that the `compareTo` method is a part of the `Comparable` interface.
Thus, if you add a `compareTo` method, you should make your class extend the
`Comparable` interface.

```java
public class Pet implements Comparable<Pet> {
    private String name;
    
    Pet(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int compareTo(Pet other) {
        return name.compareTo(other.name);
    }
    
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return other instanceOf Pet && compareTo((Pet) other) == 0;
    }
}
```

While the `Comparable` interface doesn't strictly require you to override `.equals()` method, it's typically a good idea to do so (and in a way consistent to `.compareTo`).

## `.compare()`

This method isn't used that much in the AP CS curriculum, but is sometimes useful.
We use this method when implementing a `Comparator` object.

Say we want have a group of students, with each having a given ID, name, etc.
Now, let's presume that we need to be able to sort them by their ID in some situations,
and by their name in others. How do we manage that?

Java provides us with a solution to this problem. There's an overloaded 
sorting method that allows us to pass in a `Comparator object`.

```
Arrays.sort(T[] arr, Comparator<T> obj)
```

The idea is that we pass in a custom object that allows us to sort objects however
we want. An example might make this idea a bit more concrete.

```java
class Pet {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    
    Pet(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class SortByAge implements Comparator<Pet> {
    int compare(Pet a, Pet b) {
        return a.getAge() - b.getAge();
    }
}
```

When writing a `.compare()` function, we apply the same rules we apply when writing
the `.compareTo()` method.
