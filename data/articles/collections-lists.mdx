summary: All about the collections List interface.

The `List` interface is used to represent a sequentially ordered group 
of items, numbered by indexes (0 based indexing).

Typically, when dealing with the `List` interface, we are dealing with 
`ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. `Vector` is technically supported, but typically is not used.

## ArrayLists

An `ArrayList` functions as a dynamically sized array. For the full list of methods, see the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html). Here are the most commonly used methods:
- `boolean add(E element)`
  - Appends the element to the end of the list
  - Always returns true
- `void add(int index, E element)`
  - Inserts the element so the given index is its position in the list
- `E remove(int index)`
  - Removes the element at the specified position
  - Returns the removed element
- `boolean remove(Object o)`
  - Removes the first occurence of our object
  - Returns if an object was removed
- `E set(int index, E element)`
  - Sets the value at index to our new element
  - Returns the previous element
- `void clear()`
  - Clears the array
- `Object clone()`
  - Returns a shallow copy of the array

> [!NOTE]
> For the `clone()` method, we are creating a new 
> array with the **same references** as the array we are cloning.

An `ArrayList` has two properties: its **size**, and **capacity**.
What does this mean? The size is the number of elements currently
inside the list, and the capacity is the size of the underlying array
that holds contains our list items. As a programmer, we typically don't 
need to worry about the capacity of our list.
