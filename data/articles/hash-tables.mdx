## Lookup Tables

Lookup tables rely on some function that can convert our **key** into some 
**index** in an array. In addition, each key can only be mapped to **one** index.

Let us say we have an array $n$ to store our table, and some function $f(k)$ that
converts our key $k$ into some value. Then, all values of $f(k)$ must be 
in the range of $[0, n)$ and it must be a **one to one mapping**. That is, 
each key can only map to one value, and vice versa.

Lookup tables are most often used for quick data retrieval; by precomputing a 
lookup table, we can save a lot of computation time.

As a trivial example, let's say we need to calculate $3^n$ many times. Instead 
of manually computing this power every time, we can instead store each power in 
a lookup table. By doing this, we turn a somewhat expensive computation into 
a quick array indexing operation.

Lookup tables also have more complex applications; for example, they can also 
be used to efficiently find the number of set bits in a binary number (e.g. 
the number 37 is equal to `00100101` in binary, so it has 3 set bits). For those curious,
[this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) explains
how we can use a lookup table to optimize this operation.

## Hash Tables

For now, let's think of a hash table as being a `HashSet`. That is, we want 
our table to support the following operations:
- Insert items 
- Remove items 
- Query if item is present in set

Note that a `HashMap` would be implemented in practically the same way as a `HashSet`.
A `HashMap` can be viewed as a `HashSet` of $(\text{key, value}$) pairs, where 
we only hash the keys. 

Hash tables operate on a similar philosophy to lookup tables; we need some 
function that can turn our key into a valid array index. However, for hash tables,
**our hash function does not need to be invertible**. That is,
we can allow our hash function to return the same value for different keys.

A **collision** is when two different keys map to the same hash value. For example,
let's say we have a hash table of strings, and we want to insert the strings 
$\text{“dog”}$ and $\text{“cat”}$. If $\text{hash}(\text{“dog”})$ and $\text{hash}(\text{“cat”})$ map to the same location in the array, then we have a collision.

Like a lookup table, hash tables are internally an array that stores all the values
we put into it. We generally want our hash function to uniformly distribute our 
values, to avoid excessive collisions.

For now, let's think of our hash table as functioning like a `HashSet`. That is,
we want our hash table to support adding, removing, and checking if an element
is in the table.

### Handling Collisions

There are two methods to handling collisions: **probing** and **chaining**. The method we choose to 
handle collisions will determine how we find elements in our table.

In AP CS, we mainly care about chaining. However, probing is also a very common 
strategy to resolve collisions; thus, it's a good idea to understand the basics behind how probing works.

#### Chaining

At each indice in our hash table array, we keep a list of elements that keeps 
track of which elements are present at this indice. Typically, we call this list of 
elements a **bucket**. To search for an element, we iterate through the item's respective bucket and see 
if it's there. 

As a note: if we want to handle the operations that a `HashSet` needs, then 
we need to make our list inside our table a `LinkedList`, not an `ArrayList`.
Something like a `TreeSet` would also work, but would probably be slower if our 
hash function is good enough.

When it comes to implementing chaining, we need to decide which data structure 
to use to represent our buckets. We have two main options:
- Linked lists: fast deletion, slow searching, good constant factor 
- Binary search trees (e.g. TreeSet): fast deletion, fast searching, bad constant factor 

Java's implementation of hash tables (`HashSet` and `HashMap`) use chaining. As 
for buckets, it uses linked lists when buckets are small, and BSTs when they become 
too large.

#### Probing

In this case, every cell in our hash table is either empty or contains some 
value inserted into our set. For now, let's only consider the cases of searching for 
and inserting elements; deleting elements is a bit more nuanced.

Let's consider inserting an element that maps to some indice $i$ in our table. For now, let's assume this element is 
not already in our table. Then, we would linearly search through our array until 
we find an empty cell. 

```
function insert(hash_table, key):
	idx = HashFunction(key) % table_size

	while (hash_table[idx] != EMPTY):
		// d is some arbitrary increment, typically set to 1
		idx = (idx + d) % table_size 
	
	hash_table[idx] = key 
```

Now, let's say we need to search for an element. We follow practically 
the same procedure as insertion. However, we stop whenever we either 
encounter an empty cell or the element we are searching for. The reason we can 
stop once encountering an empty cell is because we know that the element we want 
would have been inserted at that empty cell if it was present in our set (or it would 
have been encountered earlier).

Deletion is a tad tricky; recall how, to search for an item, we always stop once 
at an empty cell. However, deleting a given item will mess up the search process
for any item that had to "jump" over the item we want to delete. There are a few 
ways of addressing this issue which are beyond the scope of what we need to know. 
For those curious, the deletion process is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing).

### Load Factor

With a hash table, we want to make our hash table's roughly proportional to the 
number of items inside our hash table. If we have a huge amount of elements in 
a really small table, then we are more likely to many collisions, which
would hinder the performance of our hash table.

To prevent the scenario above from happening, we want to resize our hash table
every so often. We define the **load factor** to be the following:

$$
\text{loadFactor} = \frac{\text{numItems}}{\text{tableSize}}
$$

We also define a constant **load factor limit**. If our current 
load factor is greater than our load factor limit, then we need to expand
our hash table.

To expand our hash table, we have to increase the size of our table, and rehash
all of our elements. Recall how the indice we place an element at is modulo
the table size; if our table size changes, then the indice we place our element
at also changes.

Generally, we set our load factor to $0.75$, and we double the size of our table
every time we hit the load factor. If our load factor is too large, we will have
too many collisions because multiple elements will get mapped to the same bucket.
However, if our load factor is too small, we will end up with a lot of empty buckets,
which is wasteful.
