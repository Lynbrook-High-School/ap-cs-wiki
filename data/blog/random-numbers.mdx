summary: How to randomly generate numbers in Java.
---

Say we want to generate some real number in the range $[0, 1)$. How can we do this?

Java provides us a convenient solution to this problem. In the library `java.lang.Math`, there is a 
`random()` method that does exactly what we want it to do. Here's an example of how it works.

```java 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Math.random()); // prints 0.830048089988098
    }
}
```

Here is some basic information about the method, taken from 
[Oracle's documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random--).

`public static double random()` returns a double value greater than or 
equal to `0.0` and less than `1.0`, with values being chosen pseudorandomly 
and with roughly uniform distribution.

> [!NOTE]
> If you try running the code snippet above multiple times, you will see that

> generator used for `Math.random()` is seeded based off of the current time.

## Example 1

Here's an easy example for when you would need to use the `Math.random()` function.
In the 2024 AP CS exam, the following problem was posed.

> Write the simulateOneDay method, which simulates numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the 
> feeder for one day. The method determines the amount of food taken from the feeder on this day and 
> updates the currentFood instance variable. The simulation accounts for normal conditions, which 
> occur 95% of the time, and abnormal conditions, which occur 5% of the time. 

We can ignore the context of the problem. Here, they require us to do one thing `95%` of the time,
and another thing `5%` of the time. How can we do this?

The most straightforward way is to first generate a random number $x$, and check if $x < 0.95$. 
If so, we do the thing we want to do `95%` of the time. Otherwise, we do the thing we want to do
`5%` of the time.

## Example 2

This example is taken from the same FRQ as the other one. 

> Under normal conditions, the simulation assumes that on any given day, only birds visit the feeder and 
> that each bird at the feeder consumes the same amount of food. This standard amount consumed is 
> between 10 and 50 grams of food, inclusive, in 1-gram increments. That is, on any given day, each bird 
> might eat 10, 11, . . . , 49, or 50 grams of food. The amount of food eaten by each bird on a given day is 
> randomly generated and each integer from 10 to 50, inclusive, has an equal chance of being chosen. 

Flavortext aside, what they want us to do is generate some number in the range $[10, 50]$. 
How can we do this?

First, let's generate a random number with `Math.random()`.

```java
double randNum = Math.random();
```

Now, we want to first generate some number in the range $[0, 40]$, and then add $10$ to our 
answer. To accomplish the first task, we multiply our answer by the width of the range. 
Afterwards, we add the lower bound of the range.

```java
double randNum = Math.random() * 41 + 10;
```

Note that here, we don't multiply the random number by $40$, but $41$. Why is that?
Remember how `Math.random()` returns a value in the range $[0, 1)$. That means that it can 
never return 1, meaning that our random number could never equal $40$.

Now, to use it as an integer, we cast our random number into an integer. 

```java
double randNum = Math.random() * 41 + 10;
System.out.println((int) randNum); // prints 15
```
