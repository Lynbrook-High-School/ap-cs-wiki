summary: How to read input in Java.
---

Printing in Java is simple; we use the `System.out.print()` method. But how do we read input?

One way we can do it is using `java.util.Scanner`, which is a class we can use for reading all sorts of input.

To start, we initialize our `Scanner`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    }
}
```

Some things to note:
- We need to import `java.util.Scanner`
- When initializing our `Scanner` object, we need to pass in a parameter

The parameter we pass into the constructor is the **input stream** we are using. An input stream is the source of the data we are reading in. Typically, we use the following streams:
- `System.in` is for the terminal
- `"file_name"` for reading from a text file

In the context of AP CS, we typically use `System.in`.

## Common Methods

 Let's consider the following
code.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String val = sc.next();
        System.out.println(val);
    }
}
```

```
Input:
AP CS
```

```
Output:
AP
```

To get the next string in our input, we call the `next()` method. To get the entire
next line, we use the `nextLine()` method.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String val = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println(val);
    }
}
```

```
Input:
AP CS
```

```
Output:
AP CS
```

> [!NOTE]
> In Java, Strings are separated by whitespace (spaces or newlines). Thus, 
> in a String `"A B C"`, `next()` would return `"A"`. However, it's worth noting 
> that `nextLine()` does not care about spaces; it just prints all the content on 
> the current line (which includes spaces).

If we want to read in a number, then we can use the following methods:
- nextInt()
- nextDouble()
- nextLong()

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int val = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(val);
    }
}
```

```
Input:
1234
```

```
Output:
1234
```

There are more, but those are the ones typically used. Scanner can read in most 
primitive types.

## More Nuanced Examples

Say we want to read a pair of items: one `int`, and one `String`, separated by spaces.
How can we do that with the `Scanner` class?

We can use the aforementioned `nextInt()` and `next()` methods. Because our text
is split by spaces, this works out to be the most natural solution.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int val_1 = sc.nextInt();
        String val_2 = sc.next();
        System.out.println(val_1 + " " + val_2);
    }
}
```

```
Input:
5 Bob
```

```
Output:
5 Bob
```

Let's consider the following code. What is printed by it?

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String first = sc.next();
        String second = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println(first);
        System.out.println(second);
    }
}
```

```
Input:
ap cs
```

Somewhat surprisingly, this prints the following:

```
Output:
ap 
 cs
```

Why is this? A look at another example might make it a bit more clear.

```
Input:
ap  cs
```

```
Output:
ap
  cs
```

In the second example, our input stream for this line starts off as this:

```ap  cs```

Once we call `next()`, we only have the following text on our line:

```  cs```

Then, `nextLine()` prints out the rest of the content on the line.
